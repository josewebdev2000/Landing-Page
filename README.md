# Landing Page

## Overview

This is my solution of the Landing Page Project of The Odin Project.

The project is the main page of a fictitious photography company I made up named "Studio Soul"
### Note

This project is <strong>NOT</strong> responsive. As a result, it will look horrible in tablets and smartphones.

If you want to appreciate my project please do so from a desktop or laptop computer that is at least <strong>1185px</strong> wide.
